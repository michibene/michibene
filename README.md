UI designer">

As a landscape architect I am close to design and 3D modeling. This job taught me how to handle multiple tasks and adhere to strict deadlines. But I've always been curious about how feature-rich web apps work. I really like to learn new things and I like graphic design.

This curiosity and eagerness resulted in the completion of the junior programmer course - mainly JAVA for start and JavaScript in the project phase (backend & frontend). Presentation of this project - Student Management App, can be found here:

(20min). I would like to continue this journey with my first full-stack developer job with the opportunity to learn the basics of UX.
